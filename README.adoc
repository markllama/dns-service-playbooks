== DNS Service Playbooks

This Repository contains a set of Ansible playbooks to create a complete DNS
service on multiple hosts, with a single hidden master server and multiple
slave and caching servers.

Eventually it will contain a playbook which can promote one slave to master
in case of the failure of the master.
